---

### Stage 5: Objection Handling

**Objection 1: "This is expensive"**

**Response:**
"I understand budget is a concern. Let's look at the ROI:
- Your students' performance improves → better WAEC/JAMB results → higher school reputation → more enrollments
- Teachers save 3+ hours/week → can teach more effectively → happier teachers
- At ₦500/month per student, that's ₦17/day. Less than a sachet of pure water. But the impact on their future is priceless.
- Plus, we offer a free first month to prove value. If it doesn't work, cancel anytime. No risk.
- And annual payment saves you 20%."

**Alternative offers:**
- Start with one class (SS3) to prove value, then expand
- Phased rollout: Start small, scale as budget allows
- Explore corporate sponsorship or NGO funding
- For public schools: Apply for government subsidy or go with free tier

---

**Objection 2: "We don't have devices/internet"**

**Response:**
"Great question! We designed ExamsTutor specifically for Nigerian schools, knowing infrastructure varies:

**Devices:**
- Students can use personal phones (most SS2-SS3 students have phones)
- School computer lab (even 10-15 PCs is enough for rotating access)
- We have partnerships with Tecno/Samsung for subsidized education devices

**Internet:**
- Offline mode: Download content in computer lab, use at home without internet
- Our pilot school in Owo had similar challenges - offline mode was a game-changer
- We have MTN/Airtel education data bundles (₦200 for 1GB - 50% discount)
- Zero-rated domain (no data charges for *.examstutor.ng)

Let's schedule a site visit to assess your infrastructure and customize a solution."

---

**Objection 3: "Teachers might resist technology"**

**Response:**
"That's actually a common concern that we've solved! Here's how:

- We provide 2-day comprehensive teacher training (not just a manual)
- Teachers love the dashboard because it shows them exactly who needs help and with what
- ExamsTutor doesn't replace teachers - it amplifies them. Teachers in our pilot saved 3 hours/week on repetitive explanations
- 95% of our pilot teachers use the dashboard regularly, and 90% want to continue
- We provide ongoing support (WhatsApp group, weekly office hours, on-demand help)

In fact, teachers become your biggest advocates because they see the impact on their students."

---

**Objection 4: "We already use [Competitor]"**

**Response:**
"That's great that you're already using EdTech! What do you like about [Competitor]? What's missing?"

[Listen to their response]

"Here's what makes ExamsTutor different:
- **Offline mode** (most competitors require constant internet)
- **Nigerian curriculum focus** (specifically built for WAEC/JAMB, not adapted from foreign content)
- **Teacher dashboard with actionable insights** (not just student-facing)
- **Proven results**: 18% improvement in 4 weeks from our pilot
- **Local support**: We're based in Nigeria, understand your context

Would you be open to a side-by-side comparison? We can run a pilot with one class for free."

---

**Objection 5: "We need to think about it"**

**Response:**
"Absolutely, this is an important decision. To help you think through it, can I ask:
- What specific aspects do you need to think about? (uncover real objection)
- What information would help you make a decision?
- Is there anyone else who needs to be part of this conversation?
- What's your timeline for making a decision?

[Address specific concerns]

How about this: Let's start with a free trial - zero risk, no credit card. You can evaluate with your teachers and students, see the results firsthand, then decide. Fair?"

**4. Pilot Close**
