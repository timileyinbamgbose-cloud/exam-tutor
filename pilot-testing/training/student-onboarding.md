## Main Features (How to Use ExamsTutor AI)

### 🎓 Feature 1: Ask Questions to Your AI Tutor

**This is the core feature - use it often!**

**How it works:**
1. Click **"Ask Tutor"** button
2. Type your question naturally
3. Get detailed explanation
4. Ask follow-up questions if confused
5. Rate the answer (👍 or 👎)

**Example Questions:**

**Good questions:**
- "How do I solve quadratic equations using the formula?"
- "Explain photosynthesis in simple terms"
- "What is the difference between a simile and metaphor?"
- "Help me understand Newton's Second Law"

**Bad questions:**
- "Answer this" [No context]
- "All maths" [Too vague]
- "Teach me everything" [Too broad]

**Tips for better answers:**
- Be specific
- Include context if needed
- Ask one concept at a time
- Don't be afraid to ask follow-up questions

**Example Conversation:**

```
You: "How do I factorize x² + 5x + 6?"

ExamsTutor: "To factorize x² + 5x + 6, we need to find two numbers that:
1. Multiply to give 6 (the constant term)
2. Add to give 5 (the coefficient of x)

Those numbers are 2 and 3 (because 2×3=6 and 2+3=5)

So: x² + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)

Would you like to try another example?"

You: "Yes, try x² + 7x + 10"

ExamsTutor: "Great! Let's solve together...
[Detailed walkthrough]"
```

### 📝 Feature 2: Practice Questions

**Get unlimited practice in any topic!**

**How it works:**
1. Click **"Practice"**
2. Select subject and topic
3. Choose difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard, or Auto)
4. Answer questions
5. Get instant feedback
6. See explanations for wrong answers

**The magic:** ExamsTutor adjusts question difficulty based on how you're doing!
- Doing well? Questions get harder

**Example Practice Session:**

```
Topic: Algebra - Factorization
Difficulty: Auto (adapts to you)

Question 1: Factorize: 2x + 6
Your answer: 2(x + 3) ✅ Correct!
[Next question gets slightly harder]

Question 2: Factorize: x² - 9
Your answer: (x - 3)² ❌ Not quite
Correct answer: (x + 3)(x - 3)
Explanation: This is difference of two squares...
